# Nexus
Python Command Line

Nexus Command Line Information
Nexus Command Line is a work in progress command line created by Cyclip.
This is the first released test and it can be quite broken.
If you find a bug, type 'report' in the console or go here. This version does not contain NLI (Nexus Library Insert), meaning you cannot create Nexus libraries, as it is heavily unstable. The commands will be there, though.

How to install
Extract the zip if you haven't already
Run the installer 'nexus.exe'
Press 'Install'
Once it is completed, open the shortcut in the zip.
This will take you to the command line
Type 'install' and it is ready for use!
